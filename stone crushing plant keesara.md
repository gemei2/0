<h3>stone crushing plant keesara</h3><img src='1703042565.jpg' alt=''><p>Stone crushing plants are essential to the construction industry, as they produce the following materials used for various construction purposes:</p><p>1. Crushed Stone - This is the largest category of aggregates used in construction and road building. It is made from various mineral materials, such as limestone, granite, trap rock, and other durable rocks. Stone crushing plants crush these minerals into smaller sizes for further processing in construction industries.</p><p>2. Sand - Another important material produced by stone crushing plants is sand. Sand is used in various construction applications, including concrete production, mortar, and plastering. It is obtained by crushing large rocks and stones into smaller pieces.</p><p>3. Gravel - Gravel is commonly used in road construction as well as in the production of concrete. It is obtained by crushing rocks and stones, similar to sand and crushed stone. Gravel comes in different sizes and is sorted according to its intended use.</p><p>One such stone crushing plant located in Keesara, a suburb of Hyderabad, Telangana State in India, is the Keerara stone crushing plant.

It can process stones with a feed size up to 32 inches and delivers a crushing capacity of up to 800 tons per hour.</p><p>The crushed stones, which are of different sizes depending on the requirement, exit the primary crusher and are conveyed to various vibrating screens for further separation. These screens ensure that the stones are sorted into their respective sizes, such as 1/4 inch, 3/8 inch, 1/2 inch, and so on.</p><p>Once sorted, the stones are then conveyed through a series of conveyor belts that carry them to different storage piles for temporary storage.
