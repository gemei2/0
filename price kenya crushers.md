For instance, a small to medium-sized crusher can cost around KSh 800,000 to KSh 1.5 million, while a large crusher can cost upwards of KSh 10 million. It is important to note that these prices are approximate and may vary depending on the seller, location, and any additional features or attachments required.</p><p>Apart from the initial investment, it is also crucial to consider the operational costs associated with the crusher. These costs include fuel or electricity consumption, maintenance, and spare parts. Arkay crushers are designed to be energy-efficient, helping to reduce operational costs in the long run. Additionally, Arkay offers excellent after-sales service, including easy availability of spare parts and prompt maintenance support.</p><p>Before purchasing a crusher, it is always recommended to do thorough research, compare prices, and evaluate the specific needs of your project.
